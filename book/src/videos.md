There are currently three videos about Salsa available, but they describe an
older version of Salsa and so they are rather outdated:

- [Salsa Architecture Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrnNvAAoQFk),
  which covers many aspects of the 2022 redesign of Salsa.
- [How Salsa Works](https://youtu.be/_muY4HjSqVw), which gives a high-level
  introduction to the key concepts involved and shows how to use Salsa;
- [Salsa In More Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY), which digs
  into the incremental algorithm and explains -- at a high-level -- how Salsa is
  implemented.
